<!-- ====== -->
Hi! Iâ€™m Xin, a PhD candidate at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. My research focuses on wearable robotics and human locomotion, particularly on augmenting human abilities during load carriage through elastic suspensions. I find it fascinating how humans move in certain ways to minimize energy expenditure and maintain balance, achievements honed over years of evolution. However, a significant portion of human locomotion mechanisms remains unknown, and I want to contribute my share to uncover some of the mysteries and enhance human locomotion abilities.

My background and history
======
I received my B.A. from China University of Mining and Technology, majoring in mechanical engineering. During my college years, I led several teams and served as a core member in various provincial and national competitions. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Chenglong Fu. During my Ph.D., I dedicated three years (2020-2023) to co-founding a startup company to provide tutoring classes. Unfortunately, it didn't survive the challenges posed by Covid-19.

I have a bit of an adventurous spirit. I enjoy hiking, camping in the wild, and sea kayaking (check out my blog posts). However, I don't like getting sunburned, so you will probably see me fully covered. Also, I enjoy photography, especially bird photography.
