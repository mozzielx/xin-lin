<b>Highlights</b>
•Fatigue of legs mainly affect the walking endurance of human body.

•Human with elastically-suspended backpack (ESB) is modeled combining bipedal model.

•The model could quantitatively predict ground reaction forces (GRFs) of each leg.

•ESBs could produce positive or negative effect of GRF under different parameters.

•The model could help us optimize structure parameters of ESBs.
